In Super Rugby Pacificâ€‚2025, we have seen that the Blues and the Crusaders balance both a grueling, fierce competition with a memorable history. In the last games, both teams have shownâ€‚their strengths and the desire to fight.
Details of aâ€‚recent match:
Blues lose to Crusaders:â€‚April 22, 25, live: Eden Park 3028, which shows the fact that the Crusaders won the warâ€‚offensively On the score sheet were Chay Fihaki, Kyle Preston, and Sevu Reece alongside a number of conversions from Taha Kemara for a final scoreâ€‚of 36--7. The Blues scored at least two tries courtesy of Dalton Papali'iâ€‚and Finlay Christie. However, as they used a better strategy, the Crusaders managed to hide theirâ€‚attempts. The Crusaders were able toâ€‚win the game because they had more runs, more meters, more clean breaks, more defenders beaten, and more stops than the Blues. In otherâ€‚words, they won.
On April 1, 2025, the Crusaders defeated the Blues 42â€“19â€‚at Eden Park. It was a match that featured a volume of attempts, a lot of good set piece work and kickingâ€‚played with a lot of smarts. By the first few minutes of the game Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tom Christie each made important plays that ledâ€‚to the Crusaders pulling away with the score. While the Blues fought valiantly,â€‚they simply couldn't bring the same level of aggression Crusaders brought. The bottomâ€‚line is this, the Crusaders in this match-up were the better team for whole of the match.
Following a trip to Eden Park on 19â€‚March 2025, the Crusaders took the ascendancy over the Blues in a 41â€“19 victory. Although both teams crossed the try line during the game, Crusadersâ€‚were far more clinical in how they finished and played a more risk-averse defence. Keep in mind that the attacking rhythm wasâ€‚mainly dictated by names such as Fihaki, Williams and Havili, which was difficult to match for the Blues. The Blues took an early bias, butâ€‚could not hold it.
The settler history and theâ€‚settler competitive:
For the 42 years since Super Rugby began, the Crusaders and Blues have faced off against oneâ€‚another. The Blues have won 12 matches against the Crusaders, whoâ€‚have won 32, with one match drawn. The Crusaders are on aâ€‚stunning run, winning 17 of their last 18 games.
Since that first season, the rivalry has been defined by fierce competition, memorable playoff series and a history of bad blood that's beenâ€‚laced with equal parts mutual respect. Notably, the Crusaders beat the Blues in the decider of the Super Rugby competition at Eden Park in 2022, thus securingâ€‚their eleventh title. It was just whatâ€‚the Blues needed to stop their long winning streak.
There is a lot of waiting between theâ€‚head-to-head duels between Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo'unga, so crucial for the conflict's imprints. They are majorâ€‚players in the meetings going on.
2025 Team Performance andâ€‚Stats
Over the last few games, the Crusaders have scored more runs (1048 against 982), more clean breaks (66 versus 41),â€‚and made more tackles and defenders beaten (215 against 162).
Everything coming together Zebre Parma struggled in their league on the start of the season butâ€‚Rob Penney's side has ensured that's not the case as they strive for success week in, week out.
To summarize:
The Blues have struggled against the Crusaders in their encounters throughout 2025, with the Crusaders coming out on top in every single clash between the two sides in recentâ€‚times without much effort. Not that there has been anything easy about the games, which have been physically hard, strategically sophisticated, and emotionally exhausting; Super Rugby Pacific is a pressureâ€‚cooker of a championship. While the Crusaders are undoubtedly capable of winning more games than theyâ€‚already have more recently, the Blues remain a serious foe that threatens that roll
