In Super Rugby Pacific 2025, we have seen that the Blues and the Crusaders balance both a grueling, fierce competition with a memorable history. In the last games, both teams have shown their strengths and the desire to fight.
Details of a recent match:
Blues lose to Crusaders: April 22, 25, live: Eden Park 3028, which shows the fact that the Crusaders won the war offensively On the score sheet were Chay Fihaki, Kyle Preston, and Sevu Reece alongside a number of conversions from Taha Kemara for a final score of 36--7. The Blues scored at least two tries courtesy of Dalton Papali'i and Finlay Christie. However, as they used a better strategy, the Crusaders managed to hide their attempts. The Crusaders were able to win the game because they had more runs, more meters, more clean breaks, more defenders beaten, and more stops than the Blues. In other words, they won.
On April 1, 2025, the Crusaders defeated the Blues 42–19 at Eden Park. It was a match that featured a volume of attempts, a lot of good set piece work and kicking played with a lot of smarts. By the first few minutes of the game Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tom Christie each made important plays that led to the Crusaders pulling away with the score. While the Blues fought valiantly, they simply couldn't bring the same level of aggression Crusaders brought. The bottom line is this, the Crusaders in this match-up were the better team for whole of the match.
Following a trip to Eden Park on 19 March 2025, the Crusaders took the ascendancy over the Blues in a 41–19 victory. Although both teams crossed the try line during the game, Crusaders were far more clinical in how they finished and played a more risk-averse defence. Keep in mind that the attacking rhythm was mainly dictated by names such as Fihaki, Williams and Havili, which was difficult to match for the Blues. The Blues took an early bias, but could not hold it.
The settler history and the settler competitive:
For the 42 years since Super Rugby began, the Crusaders and Blues have faced off against one another. The Blues have won 12 matches against the Crusaders, who have won 32, with one match drawn. The Crusaders are on a stunning run, winning 17 of their last 18 games.
Since that first season, the rivalry has been defined by fierce competition, memorable playoff series and a history of bad blood that's been laced with equal parts mutual respect. Notably, the Crusaders beat the Blues in the decider of the Super Rugby competition at Eden Park in 2022, thus securing their eleventh title. It was just what the Blues needed to stop their long winning streak.
There is a lot of waiting between the head-to-head duels between Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo'unga, so crucial for the conflict's imprints. They are major players in the meetings going on.
2025 Team Performance and Stats
Over the last few games, the Crusaders have scored more runs (1048 against 982), more clean breaks (66 versus 41), and made more tackles and defenders beaten (215 against 162).
Everything coming together Zebre Parma struggled in their league on the start of the season but Rob Penney's side has ensured that's not the case as they strive for success week in, week out.
To summarize:
The Blues have struggled against the Crusaders in their encounters throughout 2025, with the Crusaders coming out on top in every single clash between the two sides in recent times without much effort. Not that there has been anything easy about the games, which have been physically hard, strategically sophisticated, and emotionally exhausting; Super Rugby Pacific is a pressure cooker of a championship. While the Crusaders are undoubtedly capable of winning more games than they already have more recently, the Blues remain a serious foe that threatens that roll
